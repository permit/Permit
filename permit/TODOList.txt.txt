If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for 
details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain 
conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public 
License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they 
could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright 
disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes 
passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If 
your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary 
applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public 
License instead of this License.
