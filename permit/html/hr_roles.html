<h3>I. HR-related roles recorded in perMIT system</h3>
The perMIT system is used to record several HR-related roles, including
<ul>
 <li>Contacts for personnel actions and letter-related questions for the 
     Human Resources department (HR)
 <li>Authorizations to report on HR-related data
 <li>Authorizations to perform HR-related transactions
</ul>
<p>
HR contact data and other authorizations 
in the perMIT system will be maintained by the
Business Liaison Team and HR, and are also maintainable by
departmental HR Primary Authorizers.
<p>
<h3>II. Explanation of authorizations in the perMIT system</h3>
<p>
In the perMIT system, a person can have one or more Authorizations, where 
an Authorization describes a role or permission to perform some business 
function.  Even if we are describing a role that does not strictly represent 
the authority to do something, such as a contact person, we still use
the perMIT system technical term <b>Authorization</b>.
Every Authorization has three parts: a 
person (who), a function (what) and a qualifier (where). A <b>person</b> is a 
Kerberos username.  A <b>function</b> is what the person may do. A 
<b>qualifier</b> defines the area in which a person may perform that function,
for instance, an organizational unit.
<p>
HR-related Authorizations can be granted at the DLC level (e.g., 
10000429 Biology), a school or area level (e.g., 10000030 Science Area), 
or a higher level (e.g., 10000001 Provost Area, or 10000000 MIT-All).
When an Authorization is granted at a higher level than a DLC, the
Authorization applies to all DLCs within that area.  For example, 
an Authorization whose qualifier is 1000030 Science Area applies to
10000429 Biology, 10000491 Chemistry, 10000533 Mathematics, etc..
<p>
Authorizations defined in the perMIT system are distributed to the
systems that use the Authorizations for controlling access, 
such as SAP and MIT's Data Warehouse. 
<p>
<h3>III. View HR roles on the web</h3>
<p>
<small>Many employees at MIT are already authorized to view HR-related
Authorizations via the Roles web interface.  If you think you should be
authorized to view this information but you are not, see the rules for
who is allowed to view Authorizations described in the memo
<a href="/metaauth_help.html">
perMIT system Meta-authorizations</a>.</small>
<p>
Click one of the items below to view HR-related roles from the Roles
Database.
