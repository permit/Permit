You need a special

viewing authorization</a> to view these reports.

<li>
<A HREF="/audit_trail.html">
Show history of changes to Authorizations from the audit trail</A>
<BR>
The perMIT system maintains an log of all changes made to Authorizations.
This link allows you to choose from a set of reports on the audit trail
entries.
<P>
<li>
Show users <A HREF="/cgi-bin/sap-reports.pl?report_num=4">
missing REQUISITIONER or CREDIT CARD VERIFIER authorizations</A>
<BR>
This report shows a list of people who have one or
more CAN SPEND OR COMMIT FUNDS authorizations for funds or fund centers,  
but do not have either a REQUISITIONER or CREDIT CARD VERIFIER authorization.
Without either of the latter two authorizations, the CAN SPEND OR COMMIT FUNDS
authorization is meaningless.
<P>
<LI>Show users 
<a href="/cgi-bin/sap-reports1.pl?report_num=5">
missing a CAN SPEND OR COMMIT FUNDS authorization
</a>.
This report shows users with 
with REQUISITIONER or CREDIT CARD VERIFIER authorizations, but they are
not effective because the user has no
CAN SPEND OR COMMIT FUNDS authorizations for any funds or fund centers.
<P>
<li>
<A HREF="/redundant_auth.html">
Show redundant authorizations</A>
<BR>
As you know, each Authorization in the perMIT system has three parts, the
Person, Function, and Qualifier.  The Qualifier component
of each Authorization is part of a hierarchy.
Suppose person XSMITH has these two Authorizations:
<ul>
<li>XSMITH can do function INVOICE APPROVAL UNLIMITED for qualifier FC_SLOAN
<li>XSMITH can do function INVOICE APPROVAL UNLIMITED for qualifier FC_SLOAN01
</ul>
Since FC_SLOAN01 is a subset of FC_SLOAN in the Fund Center hierarchy, the 
second authorization is implied by the first.  The second authorization
can be considered redundant.
This link allows you to choose from a list of reports on redundant
authorizations.
