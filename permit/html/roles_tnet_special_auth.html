<small>
Authorizations to maintain telephone preferences by Network ID should be 
added using a special web-based tool.  You will generally want to add a 
qualifier (for a network ID) at the same time that you add an authorization 
for this network ID.  The special web-based tool allows you to do these
two actions at the same time.
<p />
To be authorized to create authorizations using this interface, you will 
need (1) a CREATE AUTHORIZATIONS authorization for category TNET and 
(2) a MAINTAIN QUALIFIERS authorization for qualifier type TNET.  Also,
to view the authorizations, you will need a VIEW AUTH BY CATEGORY authorization
for category TNET.)
