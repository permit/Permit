A Primary Authorizer is an administrator in a department who has the 
authority to grant authorizations to perform business transactions or 
report on the department's financial resources or HR data.  A Primary 
Authorizer can be a Financial Primary Authorizer, a Human Resources 
Primary Authorizer, or both.  
<p>
Financial Primary Authorizers have an authorization for the 
function <b>FINANCIAL&nbsp;PRIMARY&nbsp;AUTHORIZER</b>.  They have the authority to 
grant authorizations to report, spend, approve, etc., on 
the department's resources (cost objects, fund centers, etc.).
<p>
Human Resources Primary Authorizers have an authorization for the function 
<b>HR&nbsp;PRIMARY&nbsp;AUTHORIZER</b>.  They have the authority to 
grant authorizations to perform transactions or report on HR and 
PAYR (Payroll) data pertaining to their department.
