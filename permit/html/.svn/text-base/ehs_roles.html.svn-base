<h3>I. What are EHS-related roles?</h3>
People at MIT can have one or more roles related to the Environmental 
Health and Safety Management System, a comprehensive set of processes and 
computer-based applications that is being phased into production over the 
next few years. The roles include 
<b>organizational</b> roles, i.e., roles that give a person specific 
responsibilities within a School or Area, a DLC, or a laboratory or 
other Room Set.  There are also roles that give people specific authority 
to perform various business functions within EHS-related computer systems.
Some of these roles are held by individuals who work within the DLCs, and 
others are held by people in central offices, such as the EHS Office or 
Information Systems. 
The perMIT system is the system of record for these DLC-wide or system-wide 
roles.
See <a href="#section_iii">section III</a> for definitions.
<p>
The actual roles (or <b>authorizations</b>, as they are called in the Roles 
Database) are being maintained jointly by representatives from the 
EHS Office and the Business Liaison Team.  In the future, maintenance of 
some of these roles may, optionally, be distributed to representatives 
within the DLCs.
<p>
(In addition to the roles maintained in the perMIT system, there are some 
roles for Room Sets, e.g., ROOM&nbsp;SET&nbsp;SUPERVISOR 
and EHS&nbsp;REPRESENTATIVE, for which the 
system of record is the Labs Database.  
See <a href="#section_iv">section IV</a>.)
<p>
<h3>II. View EHS roles on the web</h3>
<p>
The EHS roles are stored as perMIT system
<b>authorizations</b>, where the <b>function</b> indicates the person's role
and the <b>qualifier</b> indicates the DLC or group of DLCs where the
person has this role.  (We use the Roles technical term
<b>authorization</b> even when people are not strictly
authorized to do anything within a computer-based system.)
The <b>functions</b> are defined in section III of this document.
<p>
<small>Currently, the authority to view these authorizations via the 
web is available only to people with an explicit "VIEW AUTH BY CATEGORY" 
authorization for category "EHS".  The rules may change to give default 
authority to more people at MIT, similar to the default viewing authority that 
exists for financial authorizations.  If you think you should be
authorized to view this information but you are not, see the rules for
who is allowed to view authorizations described in the memo
<a href="/metaauth_help.html">
perMIT system Meta-authorizations</a>.</small>

<h3>III. Definition of Functions used in EHS roles</h3>
</a>
<p>
The following Functions are used in the perMIT system for definining
EHS-related roles.

      <td>A person within a DLC with a set of responsibilities related 
          to the DLC's reporting and compliance with MIT's EHS policies.

          specific reporting privileges in computer-based systems.</td>

          Room Sets within one or more DLCs, not including the authority
          to view directory-suppressed home phone numbers for contact
          people.  This authority allows the person to report on applicable 
          Room Sets both via the Data Warehouse (data to be available 
          by the end of Feb., 2003) and the web interface to the
          Labs Database (available now).</td>

          related to Room Sets for specified DLCs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>MAINTAIN EHS HAZARD TYPES</td>

          people who have specified their association with a DLC.
          Note that this applies to reporting via EHSWEB, but not 
          yet to reporting via the Traincasters site, which is not 
          yet receiving authorition information from the perMIT system.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>MAINTAIN EXTRA PI</td>
      <td>Authority to add to or delete from the check list of PIs or
          supervisors on the Training Registration pages, where trainees

          PIs and supervisors from OSP and financial data plus additional 
          supervisors directly maintained within the EHSWEB system.  
          Only a few central EHS or IS people should be granted this
          authority.</td>

<h3>IV. Definition of Functions used in the Labs Database</h3>
</a>
<p>
Roles related to the following Functions are not stored in the perMIT system, 
but they are included here because they are related to EHS.  They apply to 
Room Sets, and are recorded in Labs Database, which is the system of record
for Room Sets.
<p>
<blockquote>
<table border>
  <tr><th>Function name</th><th>Definition</th></tr>
  <tr><td colspan=2 bgcolor="#E0E0E0" align=center>
    Roles related to Room Sets</td></tr>
  <tr><td>ROOM SET SUPERVISOR</td>
      <td>The person with primary responsibility for activities and people
          within a lab or other Room Set. This is often the PI.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>SECONDARY ROOM SET SUPERVISOR</td>
      <td>A person who share responsibilities 
          for Room Set activities and people with 
          the primary ROOM SET SUPERVISOR.  Most Room Sets do not have 
          a secondary supervisor, but a few Room Sets have one or more 
          of them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>EHS REPRESENTATIVE</td>
      <td>The person with primary responsibility for compliance with EHS 
          policies and guidelines within the Room Set.  This is often 
          a post doc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>SECONDARY EHS REP</td>
      <td>The person who shares responsibility for compliance with EHS 
          policies and guidelines with the primary EHS REPRESENTATIVE.
          Most Room Sets do not have a secondary EHS Rep, but a few 
          have one or more of them.</td>
