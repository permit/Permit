A Primary Authorizer is an administrator in a department who has the 
authority to grant authorizations to perform business transactions or 
report on the department's financial resources or HR data.  A Primary 
Authorizer can be a Financial Primary Authorizer, a Human Resources 
Primary Authorizer, or both.  
<p>
Financial Primary Authorizers have an authorization for the 
function <b>PRIMARY&nbsp;AUTHORIZER</b>.  They have the authority to 
grant authorizations to report, spend, approve, etc., on 
the department's resources (cost objects, fund centers, etc.).
<p>
Human Resources Primary Authorizers have an authorization for the function 
<b>HR&nbsp;PRIMARY&nbsp;AUTHORIZER</b>.  They have the authority to 
grant authorizations to perform transactions or report on HR data pertaining 
to their department.
<p>
There are two ways of looking up the Primary Authorizers for the various
Departments, Labs, and Centers:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The perMIT system's <a href=
"/cgi-bin/qualauth.pl?cat_qt=META%2FDEPT+%28Primary+Authorizer+auths.+by+DLC%29&detail=2&noleaf=1&levels=5">
DEPT hierarchy with Primary Authorizers</a>
<p>
This report shows people who have PRIMARY AUTHORIZER authorizations for
specific departments in the perMIT system.  They use the Roles application for 
maintaining authorizations for their department's resources.  You need
a perMIT system <a href=
"/metaauth_help.html#viewing+authorizations">
viewing authorization</a> for category META to see this report.
<p>
<li>
The Business Liaison Team's <a href=
"http://web.mit.edu/sapr3/sw_dist/authreq.html">
List of MIT Offices with Primary Authorizers and contacts</a>
<p>
This report lists not only the Primary Authorizers defined
in the perMIT system, but also the non-electronic Primary Authorizers who do
not use the Roles application. In this report, MIT's organizational units are 
organized differently than those the Roles report, and there are some 
organizational units that are not considered departments in the Roles DEPT 
hierarchy.
</ul>
