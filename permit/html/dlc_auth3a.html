<H1>SAP authorizations for a department - test version</H1></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
<small>Note: This test version handles certain grouped departments differently.
If a department has a parent department that has direct links to 
Funds Centers, Profit Center nodes, etc. (e.g., departments D_CHEME, D_ACAD,
D_SFS have parent departments such as D_ASO,
D_DUE, D_DSL), then it will look not only for authorizations for the
specified department, but for the parent department as well.</small>
<p>
Most cost objects, fund centers, funds, spending groups, and other
perMIT system "qualifiers" have been organized into an unofficial 
<a 
href="/cgi-bin/qualauth.pl?qualtype=DEPT+%28MIT+departments+%28unofficial%29%29&noleaf=1&levels=20"
>
hierarchy of Departments, Labs, and Centers</a>.
Using this hierarchy, it is possible to find and display authorizations for
qualifiers related to a given Department.
<P>
<i>Note: This report, based on the department hierarchy, is more complete 
than an older report based on authorizations within a branch of the 
Fund Center hierarchy. However, the older report may be useful if you are
interested in only a subset of a department. 
<a href="dept_auth.html">Go to older report.</a>
</i>
<P>
There are three "filter options" for selecting department-related 
authorizations
to be displayed.  Filter option 1 finds only the authorizations whose
qualifiers are actually found under a given DLC in the hierarchy.  Filter
option 2 selects authorizations for display through a 2-step process that
shows all authorizations for any person who has at least one authorization
directly related to a DLC.  Filter option 3 also uses a 2-step process, 
finding people who have at least one authorization directly related to the
DLC, and then showing those people's authorizations whose qualifiers are 
found under the DLC plus their authorizations with NULL qualifiers.
<P>
For example, if you specify department D_SLOAN, the report:
<ol>
<li>finds all people having authorizations for a qualifier of any 
Fund Center, Spending Group, Cost Object, Profit Center, etc. that falls
under D_SLOAN, and then
<li>shows some or all SAP 
authorizations (spending, reporting, approving, etc.) for those people, 
depending on the chosen Filter option.
</ol>
