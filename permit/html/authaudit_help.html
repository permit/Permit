<p>
Since April of 1998, the perMIT system has maintained an audit trail of
all changes to Authorizations.  If you have the appropriate
<a href="/metaauth_help.html#viewing+authorizations">
viewing authorization</a> you can display selected data from the audit trail.
<p>
<h4>What is stored in the Authorizations audit trail?</h4>
Whenever a change is made to an Authorization, information is saved about
the user who made the change, the date,
time, and type of action, plus data about the affected Authorization.
The type of action can be Insert,
Delete, or Update.  One audit record is stored for each Insert or Delete.
For each <A HREF="#what update">Update</a>, there are 
<A HREF="#why not pairs">two audit records</a>, one
showing the data from the Authorization before the update and one showing data
after the update. 
<H4>The Authorization history display includes the 
following fields:</H4>
<table border>
<tr><th>Modified<br>By</th><td>
Kerberos username of the person who made the change.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Modified<br>Date</th><td>
Date that the Authorization change was made.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Modified<br>Time</th><td>
Time that the Authorization change was made. Times run from 00:00 - 23:59.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>Action</th><td>
Type of action.  Can be "Insert", "Delete", "Update&lt;" (data before the 
change) or "Update&gt;" (data after the change).</td></tr>
<tr><th>Kerberos<br>Username</th><td>
The username to which the Authorization applies.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Function<BR>Name</th><td>The short name of the Function component
of the Authorization.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Qualifier<BR>Code</th><td>The Organizational Unit, Fund Center, Cost
Object, or other item that limits the data for which the Person can perform
the Function.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Do,<BR>Grant</th><td>Two comma-separated fields. Do-function: can the 
user do the function in the authorization? (Y or N).  Grant: can the user 
grant this authorization?  (Y or N)
</td></tr>
<tr><th>Effective<BR>Date</th><td>The effective-date field from the
authorization.  This field can be used to cause an Authorization to remain
inactive until some future date.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>Expiration<BR>Date</th><td>The expiration-date field from the
authorization.  This field can be used to cause an Authorization become
inactive after a given date.
</td></tr>

<A NAME="why not pairs">
<h4>Why are some update records not shown in pairs?</h4></A>
There are two audit records for every Update action, but
sometimes one of the two records is not displayed because the criteria
for selecting audit records filters it out.  It is possible for an 
Update action to change the Kerberos username in an Authorization; subsequent
displays of "changes to authorizations for a person" will only match one of
the two Kerberos usernames in the audit record pair.
<br>
(It would be possible to change the SQL select statement that displays
the results so that the "missing" audit record would always be displayed, but
this would slow down the query.)

<A NAME="what update">
<h4>Why are there sometimes update records when nothing seems to have
changed?</h4></A>
A simple database "trigger" updates the audit trail for Authorization changes.
There are two ways that update records can be generated when it appears
that nothing has changed in an Authorization:
<ul>
<li>A field in an Authorization changed, but the changed field is not included
in this display.  Most often, this field is the Qualifier Name field.  When
a Qualifier Name is changed in the Qualifier table (for example, when a 
Fund Center name is modified), the name change is reflected in Authorizations
that refer to that Qualifier.  This causes audit trail records to be
generated for the affected Authorization.  You won't see the change in the
display because the Qualifier name field is not shown.
<li>
Someone clicked the 'Replace' button for an Authorization in the Roles 
application but didn't change any fields.
</ul>
It would be possible to have the database trigger ignore some Update events.
However, the philosophy behind the trigger is to keep it as simple and 
inclusive as possible.  It is better to have some extraneous data in the 
audit trail than risk filtering out data that could be useful for
diagnosing unforeseen future problems or tracking unusual database activity.
