2. Make sure the various feed programs are uptodate and running 
   properly.
   a. xsap_feed
      These are already running against the production (old) Roles DB
   b. bin/roles_feed  -- Evening and morning jobs
      i. Locate the jobs that send data to other systems.  
         Make sure we've got the newest versions on cloverleaf.
         Get them working against the old Roles production DB, and  
         stop running them on cinnamon.
      ii. For the jobs that feed data into the Roles DB, 
          make sure that we've got the newest versions on cloverleaf.
          Get them working against the old Roles production DB.  
          Stop running them on cinnamon.

3. Do some spot checks to make sure that Oracle 9 does not break any 
   of the nightly feed programs.
