<h1>Master Department Hierarchy - Guide to Maintaining Departments and Links</h1>
<p />
<h3>Overview</h3>
At MIT, as at most institutions, organizational units are represented 
differently within different systems.  The code for a given department
will be different in the HR system, the financial system, and the 
Student Information system.  Departmental objects in are organized 
differently in different systems -- DLCs (Departments, Labs and Centers) 
are grouped differently within the tree of HR Org Units, the 
tree of Funds Centers, and the Student Systems tree of schools and 
academic courses.  Furthermore, in different systems, some DLCs are 
not represented at all or are "absorbed" by another DLC.

* Skill sets / types of maintenance
  a. 1 or 2 people who enter most of the changes to DLCs and links,
     and review exception reports.  (If these people are different than 
     (b) then there will be some complex situations where they will need 
     to defer to (b).)
  b. DRS people who understand the way the system works and interfaces
     with Warehouse, Roles DB, etc..  May be that (a) is not needed and
     all of the work can fall under (b).
  c. Technical person/people who understand the subleties the system; 
     these people will make config file and documentation changes if
     we add or change object types, link types, or MDH hierarchy views

  Make s clear statement: This system can run reliably with poor documentation
  and good people with the right level of understanding, but it cannot 
  work reliably no matter how good the documentation is if we don't have
  the right kind of people acting as custodians.

* How-to documents
  - Current set of views, DLC types, and link types
    o These may change over time
    o What are they, why are they

  - How to add, delete a link between an object (e.g., PC, Org Unit,
    SIS org unit, BAG, etc.) and a DLC
    o what to watch for

  - Links between objects and higher-level department units -- where are
    these appropriate and how do they work?

  - Adding a new DLC

  - Changing characteristics of a DLC or other departmental object

  - Moving a DLC

  - Combining DLCs
