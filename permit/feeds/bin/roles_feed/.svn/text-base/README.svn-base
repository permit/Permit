Roles Feed Program README File
------------------------------

This README file contains a brief description of the Roles Feed
Program used to update person and qualifier information in the MIT
Roles Database as well as to extract information out of the Roles
Database for other systems.

This directory contains a single executable Perl script
(roles_feed.pl) and a number of Perl Modules (*.pm).

There exists a symbolic link in $ROLES_HOMEDIR/bin to this file.  This
link is called via various cronjobs in $ROLES_HOMEDIR/cronjobs.

The Perl modules in this directory contain business logic specific to
each roles database feed.

This directory also contains a sub-directory called "cpa" which
contain more generic Perl Modules.
