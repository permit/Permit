Updating Funds and Fund Centers
-------------------------------

1. compare_fund1.pl
   Reads in 3 flat files from SAP and the Warehouse (generally transferred to 
   /warehouse/transfers/sapuser/ directory on Virginia), and produces
   "fund.warehouse".
2. compare_fund2.pl
   Reads qualifier table from the Roles DB and produces the file
   "fund.roles".
3. compare_fund3.pl
   Reads fund.warehouse and fund.roles and produces the file fund.actions
   (which lists ADD, UPDATE, and DELETE actions to be performed on 
   Roles DB tables to bring Qualifier and related tables uptodate).
3a.
   Before going on to the next step, make sure that ADD records for
   Fund Centers (FCnnnnnn) are moved ahead of ADD records for Funds
   (Fnnnnnnn) in the file fund.actions.  This allows parent Fund Centers
   to be processed before their child Funds.
4. fund_add.pl
   Edit this file (to make sure it points to the rignt files).  This
   script processes the 'ADD' records from fund.actions and produces
   fundadd.data and fundadd.child files.
5. insert_newqual5.pl
   Run this script to insert records into the Qualifier table based on
   fundadd.data.
6. insert_qc_plus.pl
   Run this script to insert records into the Qualifier_child table, based
   on fundadd.child.
7. fund_update.pl
   This script processes the 'UPDATE' records in fund.actions.  It produces
   fundupdate.sql
   The next step is to run sqlplus and "start fundupdate", then "commit".
8. fund_delete.pl
   This script processes the 'DELETE' records in fund.actions.  It produces
   fund_delete.sql.  Run sqlplus, "start fund_delete" and "commit".
9. fix_desc.pl
   This script reads "fund.actions" and finds a list of qualifiers for
   which the qualifier_descendent table needs to be updated.  It then
   generates the file "fix_desc.sql", which contains inserts and deletes
   for the qualifier_descendent table.  Run sqlplus, "start fix_desc" and
   "commit".
10. fund_fix.pl
    This script looks for 'FUND' type qualifier records where qualifier_name
    is 'Unknown'.  If there is a matching 'COST' type qualifier record (where
    the numeric part of the qualifier_code is the same), it updates the
    qualifier_name field for the 'FUND' record with the qualifier_name field
    for the matching 'COST' record.

*** Fund-related stuff that isn't done yet:
    There needs to be a new script
    to make sure the HAS_CHILD field in the QUALIFIER table is set to 
    'Y' if a qualifier has children and 'N' if not.  The fund_add.pl 
    script will make sure that when a qualifier is added to the table,
    its parent has its HAS_CHILD field set to 'Y'.  However, the fund_update.pl
    and fund_delete.pl scripts do not make any changes in the HAS_CHILD
    field for parent qualifiers.  It would be easiest to write a new
    script that looks at "fund.actions", finds a list of qualifiers that
    might possibly have a change in their HAS_CHILD field, and check
    the qualifier_child table for each of these records, changing HAS_CHILD
    if appropriate.  This should be done after step 8.
