The data subdirectory is a place holder for intermediate results created during the feeds from external 
data sources (warehouse) and cronjobs. 

It may also contain non-temporary files such as:
roles_person_extra.dat

The roles_person_extra.dat file is used to create 'users' which do not exist in the warehouse, or normal 
identity manage system. Often these are application accounts or test accounts used to access perMIT itself. 

The format of the roles_person_extra.dat file is:

ID number:last name:first name:account identifier:email contact::O:A:

Example:
999999999:SERVER:PAULSPROTOTYPES:PBH$DEV:PBH@MIT.EDU::O:A:
