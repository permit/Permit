The perMIT system has been configured to store Portal-related authorizations,
which can be extracted by the IS&amp;T-maintained portal.  Below are some
notes on how this has been set up, and how various authorizations and other
types of data can be maintained by a few specially-authorized individuals.
<p />
<h3>Quick introduction to Authorizations</h3>
<p />
Authorizations in the perMIT system are 3-part entities:
<blockquote>
  <i>Authorization = Person + Function + Qualifier</i>
</blockquote>
<p />
You can create or delete
Authorizations in the perMIT system only if you have the authority
to do so, which is itself controlled by Authorizations about 
Authorizations (<i>i.e.</i>, "meta-authorizations") within the Roles 
Database.
<p />
To create an authorization, you pick a person from the list of people at MIT,
a Function from the list of Functions for which you allowed to grant 
Authorizations, and a Qualifier related to the Function which you are allowed
to pick.  Functions are grouped into Function Categories (or application 
areas), and Qualifiers are grouped into Qualifier Types.  Each Qualifier Type
has a hierarchy of Qualifiers.  An authorization granted for a Qualifier 
which represents the root or a node within the hierarchy applies to 
all child Qualifiers.
<p />
Separate "meta-authorizations" can be assigned to allow a person to 
maintain Authorizations, Functions, and/or Qualifiers.  (Many Qualifiers 
are updated automatically from other sources, but some are maintained by 
hand.)
<p />
At the present time, Authorizations and Functions are maintained via the
MIT-developed application, which was written in PowerBuilder and can be 
downloaded for Windows from IS&T's software web site.  For Macintosh users,
it is available on Citrix.
<p />
<h3>Authorizations, Functions and Qualifiers for the Portal application</h3>
<p />
The 4-character code for the Function Category for the Portal application is 
PRTL.  Currently, there is only one Function in this category: 
<em>PORTAL_ADMIN</em>, and Authorizations for this Function must have a 
Qualifier from the tree of Portal Areas (Qualifier Type code PRTA).
Qualifiers in this tree can be added as needed using the Roles web interface
for maintaining qualifiers.  Currently, the PRTA qualifier hierarchy
has a root-level qualifier of <em>ALL_PORTAL_AREA</em> and directly under the 
root, it has two qualifiers with the following codes: <em>IS&amp;T</em> 
and <em>EHS</em>.
<p />
To give someone the Authorization to do Portal Administration for 
all areas, connect to the Roles application on Windows (native) 
or the Mac (using Citrix), and give the person the following authorization:
<blockquote>
<table border>
  <tr><th>Person</th><th>Function<br>Category</th>
      <th>Function</th><th>Qualifier</th></tr>
  <tr><td><i>the person's Kerberos principal</i></td>
      <td>PRTL</td><td>PORTAL_ADMIN</td><td>ALL_PORTAL_AREA</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
To give someone the Authorization to do Portal Administration limited
to one area, <i>e.g.</i>, EHS, connect to the Roles application 
and give the person the following authorization:
<blockquote>
<table border>
  <tr><th>Person</th><th>Function<br>Category</th>
      <th>Function</th><th>Qualifier</th></tr>
  <tr><td><i>the person's Kerberos principal</i></td>
      <td>PRTL</td><td>PORTAL_ADMIN</td><td>EHS</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p />
Existing Authorizations related to the Portal can be viewed either via 
the Roles Application or via the Roles Web interface.  For a web-based 
report on all Authorizations for the Portal application, do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Start at 
  <li>On the line labelled "Hierarchy of qualifiers with authorizations,"
      click <a href="auth_branch1.html">by category/qualifier type</a>.
  <li>Choose PRTL/PRTA from the pull-down menu for Category/Qualifier-type.
  <li>Leave the "Qualifier code" field blank and leave the default settings
      for "Format options" and "Sort by".
  <li>Click the <em>Submit</em> button.
</ul>
You will see a display of the hierarchy of Portal Areas, and under 
each Portal Area, you will see related Authorizations.  Function names
are shown in green.

<h3>Extracting authorization information from the perMIT system</h3>
<p />
To extract authorization information from the perMIT system for the 
PRTL (Portal) category, you must connect to Oracle database used by the
Roles system and use a SELECT statement.  In the near future (first 
half of calendar 2007), we plan on making available a Java interface for 
extracting this information as another alternative.  For now, the 
recommended method of extracting authorization information is to use
a Select statement.
<p />
For systems that do automated extraction of Authorization information,
we recommend setting up a special Oracle username/password for doing 
the database connection.  We do not recommend using any individual's 
personal username to run a batch job.
<p />
The view EXPANDED_AUTH_FUNC_QUAL produces "expanded" authorizations, 
<i>i.e.</i>, if the original authorization was granted for a Qualifier 
with child Qualifiers or for a Function with child Functions, it will 
show records for each child Qualifier and child Function.  It also has
a column IS_IN_EFFECT that looks at the columns EFFECTIVE_DATE,
EXPIRATION_DATE, and DO_FUNCTION, and returns a single calculated
field 'Y' or 'N' indicating whether or not the Authorization is in
effect at this moment.
<p />
A simple SELECT statement to extract Portal-related authorization
information would be the following:
<code>
<pre>
  select distinct kerberos_name, function_name, qualifier_code
    from expanded_auth_func_qual
    where function_category = 'PRTL'
    and is_in_effect = 'Y';
</pre>
</code>
Other columns are available, with information about who created the 
authorization, when it was created or is due for expiration, the
level in the Qualifier hierarchy at which original Authorization was
granted, etc..  However, the above SELECT statement is probably sufficient
for simply extracting current Authorization information.
<p />
You can use a modified version of the SELECT statement to extract 
pairs of information, with (a) Kerberos principle and (b) a combined 
field derived from the Function and the Qualifier.  The following
SELECT statement combines Function and Qualifier, does special processing
for the root qualifier, and changes the strings to lower-case:
<code>
<pre>
  select distinct lower(kerberos_name), 
    lower(replace(function_name || '_' || qualifier_code, 
            '_all_portal_area', ''))
    from expanded_auth_func_qual
    where function_category = 'PRTL'
    and is_in_effect = 'Y';
</pre>
</code>
<p />
<h3>Maintaining Portal-related Authorizations in the perMIT system</h3>
<p />
The "meta-authorization" for the authority to maintain Authorizations 
in the PRTL (Portal) category is the following:
<blockquote>
<table border>
  <tr><th>Person</th><th>Function<br>Category</th>
      <th>Function</th><th>Qualifier</th></tr>
  <tr><td><i>the person's Kerberos principal</i></td>
      <td>META</td><td>CREATE AUTHORIZATIONS</td><td>CATPRTL</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
As of this writing, Mike Berger, Mike Moretti, and Steve Landry
have this Authorization, and they all have the authority to grant or 
delete it for others.
<p />
Anyone who has this "meta-authorization" has the authority to create
or delete Authorizations in the category PRTL (Portal) that will give
people the role of a Portal Administrator in one or more areas.  They
need to use the Roles application on Windows or the Macintosh.  
See the "Software at MIT" site to download the application.
<p />
Another prerequisite for using the perMIT system application is to have a
username/password in the perMIT system Oracle database itself.  (Mike, Mike, and
Steve already have them.)  Contact business-help@mit.edu to request a 
perMIT system username, which must match the MIT Kerberos principal for the
person.  Then, go to the Roles web site to use a secure web interface 
to set (or change) your Oracle perMIT system password:
<ul>
  <li>Start at 
  <li>Click "I forgot my perMIT system password"
  <li>Follow the instructions on the next page to set a password for
      yourself.  (There are two instances of the perMIT system, a test one
      and a production one.  The web page allows you to set a password
      for yourself on both instances, but you must do one instance 
      at a time.)
  <li>The new password will take effect immediately.
</ul>
<p />
(We will not include detailed instructions for using the Roles application
here.)
<p />
<h3>Adding or changing PRTA (Portal Area) Qualifiers</h3>
<p />
Specifically authorized individuals can use the Roles web interface to
maintain Qualifiers of type PRTA.  Authorizations can only be granted on
existing Qualifiers.
<p />
The "meta-authorization" for the authority to maintain Qualifiers
of type PRTA is the following:
<blockquote>
<table border>
  <tr><th>Person</th><th>Function<br>Category</th>
      <th>Function</th><th>Qualifier</th></tr>
  <tr><td><i>the person's Kerberos principal</i></td>
      <td>META</td><td>MAINTAIN QUALIFIERS</td><td>QUAL_PRTA</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
As of this writing, Mike Berger, Mike Moretti, and Steve Landry
have this Authorization, and they all have the authority to grant or 
delete it for others.
<p />
To add, delete, or changes Qualifiers of type PTLA, do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Start at 
  <li>Click "System adminstrators tools"
  <li>Click "Maintain qualifiers within perMIT system"
  <li>Select qualifier type PTRA (Portal Areas) from the drop-down
      menu, and click the button "Manually create the data"
  <li>In the big text box, enter one or more ADD, DELETE, UPDATE, etc. 
      commands, using the formats described in the legend at the bottom
      of the page.  For example, to add a new Qualifier with code 
      FACILITIES attached to the root, enter the following
      <blockquote>
      <code>
      ADD!FACILITIES!ALL_PORTAL_AREA!Facilities portal area
      </code>
      </blockquote>
  <li>Click the button "Submit your data" once to check the 
      syntax of your transaction(s)
  <li>Click the button "Submit your data" a second time to actually
      commit the changes to the database
</ul>
<p />
<h3>Maintaining Portal-related Functions in the perMIT system</h3>
<p />
As of this writing, there is only one Function defined under the 
PRTL category.  If there is a need in the future to define different 
levels of authority for Portal administrators, then additional Functions 
can be created.
<p />
The "meta-authorization" for the authority to maintain Functions
in the PRTL (Portal) category is the following:
<blockquote>
<table border>
  <tr><th>Person</th><th>Function<br>Category</th>
      <th>Function</th><th>Qualifier</th></tr>
  <tr><td><i>the person's Kerberos principal</i></td>
      <td>META</td><td>CREATE FUNCTIONS</td><td>CATPRTL</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
As of this writing, Mike Berger, Mike Moretti, and Steve Landry
have this Authorization, and they all have the authority to grant or 
delete it for others.
<p />
Anyone who has this "meta-authorization" has the authority to create
or delete Functions in the category PRTL (Portal) that in turn can be 
used in Authorizations.  You cannot delete a Function if there are 
still Authorizations assigned for it.
<p />
As described in the section on maintaining Authorizations, you need to 
download the Roles application and set up a database username/password
for yourself prior to maintaining Functions.
<p />
We will not describe in detail how to use the Roles application to create
Functions.  However, we will describe what fields need to be defined 
in a new Function in the PRTL category.  Make sure that you specify the
following fields:
<blockquote>
<table>
  <tr align=left>
      <th>Function&nbsp;name:</th><td>A unique name, up to 30 characters, 
          containing 
          upper-case letters, numbers, and common special characters 
          such as underlines, dashes, parentheses, commas, periods, or 
          ampersands.</td></tr>
  <tr align=left>
      <th>Function&nbsp;description:</th>
      <td>Up to 50 characters, mixed case</td>
  <tr align=left>
      <th>Function&nbsp;Category:</th><td>PRTL</td></tr>
  <tr align=left>
      <th>Qualifier&nbsp;Type:</th><td>PRTA</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
