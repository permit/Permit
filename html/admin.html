<BR>
Below are some perMIT system web pages that will be useful to people who
maintain qualifier hierarchies in the perMIT system or Funds/Fund Centers
in SAP.  See also <A HREF="more_auth.html">
miscellaneous authorization web pages</A>.
<P><HR><BR>
Rules-based authorizations: 
<a href="auth_rules.html">Links to reports, UI for setting rules, etc.</a>
<p />
Report on differences between the Approver authorizations in the PD Org and
in the perMIT system:
<br>(refreshed each day at 5 AM, 12 noon, and 4 PM)
<ul>
<li>Abridged report: 
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/pdorg_compare.pl?show_all=n">
Show differences for matchable Spending Groups only</A> 
<li>Unabridged report: 
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/pdorg_compare.pl?show_all=y">
Show all differences</A> (including spending groups
that cannot be matched because the [spending group code] has not been 
included in the org. name field in the PD Org).
</ul>
<P>
A clean-up aid for the SAP standard hierarchy of Funds/Fund Centers:
<BR>
Each Fund Center in SAP's standard hierarchy of Fund Centers should have
as its children either all Funds or all Fund Centers, not a combination of 
of the two.  Authorized individuals can display a list of Fund Centers 
that break this rule.
<BR>
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/sap-reports.pl?report_num=2">
Show Fund Centers that break the "one kind of children" rule</A> 
<BR>
<BR>
A clean-up aid for the Custom Fund Center hierarchy:
<BR>
In most cases, a Fund Center should only be a member of one Spending Group.
You can display a list of Fund Centers that break 
this rule. Certificates and a meta-authorization are required to use 
this web page.
<BR>
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/sap-reports.pl?report_num=3">
Show Fund Centers that belong to more than one Spending Group</A> 
<P />
Show <A HREF="/cgi-bin/roles_exception_reports.cgi?report_num=1">qualifiers with an inactive status</a>. (These are usually 
qualifiers that should be deleted but must have their related authorizations
deleted first.)
<P />
Run <A HREF="/roles_quarterly_stats.html">quarterly report statistics</a>.
<P />
For authorized administrators only: <A HREF="/cgi-bin/update_roles_parameters.cgi">Update perMIT system parameters for data feeds and other processes</a>.
<p />
Maintain the list of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/rel_str.cgi">Model 1 (Release Strategy) Funds Centers</a>. 
(To use this feature, you need an authorization to 'MAINTAIN MOD 1 FC'.)
<p />
Make additions or changes to one of the Qualifier hierarchies.  You are
probably not authorized to use this Web page;  this web page can only be
used by a few Roles administrators.<BR>
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/qualmaint/RolesQM.pl">
Maintain qualifiers within perMIT system.</A>
<p> 
<b>Roles users reports</b> (for system administrators with 
'VIEW ADMIN REPORTS' authorization):
<ul>
<li><a href="/person_history.html">
Users whose directory information has changed</a> 
(e.g., department or employment changes)
<li><a href="/auth_creators.html">
People who can create authorizations</a> in the perMIT system.
<li><i>New:</i> <a href="/auths_created_summary.html">
Number of authorizations created by a person</a> for a given time period.
<LI><a href="/missing_users.html">
Missing Roles usernames</a>, i.e., users who can create authorizations,
but are waiting for a perMIT system username/password.
<LI><a href="/cgi-bin/roles_db_users.cgi">
Roles usernames</a>, and the last time they connected to the database.
<LI><i>For specially-authorized administrators:</i> 
<a href="/cgi-bin/roles_db_users_edit.cgi">
Add or delete Roles usernames</a>
</ul>
