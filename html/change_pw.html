<h3>
  Before You Proceed: Get A Secure Web Certificate </h3>
<SMALL><p>To change your Roles password, you must first <a href="http://web.mit.edu/is/help/cert/">get 
  secure web certificates</a> from the MIT Certificate Server.  </p>
<p>If you already have a username and password for the perMIT system, you can 
  change your password via this secure web interface. </p>
<p>
You can use this interface even if you've <i>forgotten</i> your perMIT system password, since the web script uses your 
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/is/help/cert">Secure 
  Web Certificate</a> to verify who you are.</p>
<p>Remember, your username in the perMIT system must be the same as your Kerberos 
  username, but your password on Roles should be <b>different</b> than your Kerberos 
  password. </p></SMALL>
