<H1>Rough approximation of SAP authorizations for a "department"</H1></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
<i>For most users, the newer <a href="dlc_auth.html">display of SAP 
authorizations based on the department hierarchy</a> 
will be a better choice than this report.  However,
the other report requires you to specify a whole department, whereas this
report allows you to specify any custom or standard Fund Center, which 
could represent a subset of a department.</i>
<P>
This report will first find
a list of people who "can spend or commit funds," "report by fund/fc,"
do "invoice approval unlimited" or "travel documents approval" on at least 
one fund or fund center within a given branch of the Fund Center hierarchy, 
and then find and display all SAP authorizations for that list of people.
<P>
For example, if you specify fund center group FC_SLOAN, the report:
<ol>
<li>finds all people having authorizations for a qualifier of
FC_SLOAN, FC_SLOAN01, FC100303, F1507600, or any other fund or 
fund center that falls under FC_SLOAN in the tree, and 
then 
<li>shows all SAP 
authorizations (spending, reporting, approving, etc.) for those people
</ol>
<P>
Notice that the report in this example will not necessarily show all 
authorizations related to the Sloan School.  If a person has 
reporting or approval authorizations for Sloan-related qualifiers in the
Cost/Profit Center hierarchy or in the Spending Group hierarchy but no
authorizations for funds or fund centers under FC_SLOAN, then
the person will not be selected in step (1) and none of their authorizations
will be displayed.
