<P>
<H3>What are meta-authorizations?</H3>
In the perMIT system, authorizations about authorizations are called
<strong>meta-authorizations</strong>.  Like other authorizations, a 
meta-authorization consists of a <strong>person</strong>, 
a <strong>function</strong>, and a <strong>qualifier</strong>.
Meta-authorizations belong to the Function Category "META". The three
main functions are
<ul>
<li>VIEW AUTH BY CATEGORY
<br>Allows you to view other people's authorizations within a 
Function Category, such as SAP (SAP R3) or WRHS (the Warehouse), via the Web
<P></li>
<li>PRIMARY AUTHORIZER
<br>Allows you to grant or maintain authorizations for a common set of
business functions with qualifiers related to the resources of a 
specified department.
<P></li>
<li>CREATE AUTHORIZATIONS
<br>Allows you to create an authorization for <i>any</i> function or
qualifier within a Function Category.  Only a few people have this type
of meta-authorization.  Most authority to grant authorizations to others
is restricted to certain functions and qualifiers, and is given either 
with the PRIMARY AUTHORIZER function or via the 
Grant flag of a (non-meta) authorization.</li>
</ul>
(There are also a few Meta-authorization functions that control maintenance of
other perMIT system objects; we will ignore them 
here.)

Rules for viewing authorizations on the Web</H3>
<p>
People's authorizations are not considered to be highly sensitive data, but 
it is not our policy to let <i>all</i> Web users view them.
In order to use the web interface to view authorizations for people other 
than yourself, you will usually need a VIEW AUTH BY CATEGORY authorization
for the categories (SAP, WRHS, etc.) of authorizations you want to view.
<p>
There is a special rule for viewing SAP, HR, LABD (Labor Distribution), 
ADMN (miscellaneous administrative roles), and META authorizations that
may allow you to view these authorizations even if you don't have a 
VIEW AUTH BY CATEGORY authorization.
You will be allowed to view other people's authorizations in the categories 
listed above as long as
you have at least one currently-active SAP or HR authorization.  
The reason behind
this rule is that people who have financial or HR authorizations are likely to 
have a business need to look up other people's authorizations.
<p>
<H3>How do I get a meta-authorization to view authorizations on the Web?</A></H3>
<p>Meta-authorizations
to "VIEW AUTH BY CATEGORY" will usually be given to MIT employees on request 
from a Primary Authorizer. If you don't have a Primary 
Authorizer, or don't know who that person is, contact 
the Business Liaison team (<a href="mailto:business-help@mit.edu">business-help@mit.edu</a>). 
</p>
<p>Make sure you specify: </p>
<ul>
<li>Your Kerberos principal</li>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>The <A href=/cgi-bin/rolecat.pl>Function Category
</A> or Categories for which you wish to view authorizations, 
i.e. SAP, NIMB (NIMBUS Budget system), WRHS (Data Warehouse) etc.. 
<li>Your department and reason for needing access to view the authorizations
</ul>
