<br>with Advanced Options</H3></td>

<P>
<small>
This web page allows you to view a branch of a qualifier hierarchy along
with all of the authorizations in a given category associated with 
qualifiers in that branch
of the tree.  For example, you could view the FC_CAES branch of the 
custom fund center hierarchy along with all of the people authorized to 
Spend or Commit Funds on the fund centers and funds under FC_CAES. (Warning:
You will not see authorizations on related fund centers, such as FC100132,
that are not strictly part of the FC_CAES branch of the tree.)
To use this facility, you need 
<a href=
"/metaauth_help.html#viewing+authorizations">
viewing authorizations</a> to see authorizations within the Category you
select.
</small>
<HR>
<P>
Select a Category/Qualifier type combination.  If you know the qualifier code
for the branch of the tree you want to view, enter it;  otherwise leave it 
blank and the display will start at the root of the tree.
(Qualifier codes must start with the  
<a href="qualcode_prefix.html">appropriate prefix</a>.)  Usually you should
leave the Kerberos name field blank;  if you only want to see authorizations
for one username, then enter that username.
Choose a format option and a sort option.  In most cases, skip over the
last three options, which are explained in notes at the bottom of this
page. To run the report, click the SUBMIT button.

<td><small>In the perMIT system, a given authorization is in effect for the 
specified qualifier and for all child, grandchild, etc., qualifiers in the 
hierarchy.  Enable the "Expand authorizations" option if you want to 
see the implied authorizations for child nodes on the display.  Avoid 
using this option with the COST or FUND hierarchies, where there are too 
many qualifiers in the tree for the option to work effectively.
</small></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><small>Note&nbsp;1</small></td>
<td><small>The "Show leaves" option only works with the COST, FUND, and DEPT
hierarchies.  If you specify "No" when displaying the COST hierarchy or the
FUND hierarchy, then individual cost collectors or funds will be suppressed
from the display.  This can be useful if you are interested only in Profit
Centers or Fund Centers and not the detailed objects below them.  If you 
specify "No" when displaying the DEPT hierarchy, then the various objects
linked below departments will be suppressed from the display.  Selecting 
"Default" gives the same result as selecting "Yes" except when the 
qualifier-type (from Category/Qualifier-type) is DEPT, in which case the 
various linked objects will be suppressed.
</small></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><small>Note&nbsp;2</small></td>
<td><small>The "Terminated funds" option only works with the COST and FUND 
hierarchies.  By default, terminated funds or cost collectors, i.e., those 
with a term code of 3, are suppressed from the display.  Specify "Show" to 
override the default and show them.</small></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><small>Note&nbsp;3</small></td>
<td><small>The "Show dept. links" option controls the display of an extra 
column for each qualifier.  Most qualifiers are linked to a Department.  If 
you specify "Yes", a column will be added for each qualifier displayed that 
will show which department(s), if any that the qualifier is linked to. 
This departmental linkage is important in determining the qualifiers for 
which a Primary Authorizer is allowed to create or delete authorizations.
