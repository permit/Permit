<small>
This web page allows you to view a branch of a qualifier hierarchy along
with all of the authorizations in a given category associated with 
qualifiers in that branch
of the tree.  For example, you could view the FC_CAES branch of the 
custom fund center hierarchy along with all of the people authorized to 
Spend or Commit Funds on the fund centers and funds under FC_CAES. (Warning:
You will not see authorizations on related fund centers, such as FC100132,
that are not strictly part of the FC_CAES branch of the tree.)
To use this facility, you need 
<a href=
"/metaauth_help.html#viewing+authorizations">
viewing authorizations</a> to see authorizations within the Category you
select.
</small>
<HR>
<P>
Select a Category/Qualifier type combination.  If you know the qualifier code
for the branch of the tree you want to view, enter it;  otherwise leave it 
blank and the display will start at the root of the tree.
(Qualifier codes must start with the  
<a href="qualcode_prefix.html">appropriate prefix</a>.)
Choose a format option and a sort option.
Then click the SUBMIT button.
