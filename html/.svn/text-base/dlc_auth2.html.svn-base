<H1>Authorizations for a department (all categories)</H1></TD>

</TABLE>
<P>
Most cost objects, fund centers, funds, spending groups, and other
perMIT system "qualifiers" have been organized into an unofficial
(and not-quite-complete) <a 
href="/cgi-bin/qualauth.pl?qualtype=DEPT+%28DLC's%29&levels=4&noleaf=1">
hierarchy of Departments, Labs, and Centers</a>.
Using this hierarchy, it is possible to find and display authorizations for
qualifiers related to a given Department.
<P>
There are two "filter options" for selecting department-related authorizations
to be displayed.  Filter option 1 finds only the authorizations whose
qualifiers are actually found under a given DLC in the hierarchy.  Filter
option 2 selects authorizations for display through a 2-step process that
shows all authorizations for any person who has at least one authorization
directly related to a DLC.
<P>
For example, if you specify department D_SLOAN, the report:
<ol>
<li>finds all people having authorizations for a qualifier of any 
Fund Center, Spending Group, Cost Object, Profit Center, etc. that falls
under D_SLOAN, and then
<li>shows all authorizations for those people
</ol>
