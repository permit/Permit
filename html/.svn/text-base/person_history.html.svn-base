<P>
This web page allows authorized people to display directory changes for 
Kerberos usernames who have or previously had one or more authorizations in 
the perMIT system.
The perMIT system only keeps track of directory information for people 
having a Kerberos name used in one or more current or past authorizations.
The history information 
was collected beginning in August, 2002. The first <b>start date</b> 
recorded for a 
username indicates the first date that the username was used in 
an authorization 
in the perMIT system (on or after July 29, 2002). It is <i>not</i> the 
date that the person was hired or enrolled.  A new record is entered into 
the table for a Kerberos username any time there is a change in the 
associated name, MIT ID number, 6-digit department code, department name, 
or student/employee/other status.
