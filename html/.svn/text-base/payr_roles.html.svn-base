<h3>I. Payroll-related (PAYR) roles recorded in perMIT system</h3>
The perMIT system category for Payroll authorizations is abbreviated
as PAYR. 
The perMIT system is used to record several PAYR roles, which control 
people's ability to perform various transactions in SAP or view data 
in SAP or the Warehouse.
<p />
PAYR authorizations in the perMIT system will be maintained by the
Business Liaison Team and HR, and many are also maintainable by
departmental HR Primary Authorizers.
<p>
<h3>II. Explanation of authorizations in the perMIT system</h3>
<p>
In the perMIT system, a person can have one or more Authorizations, where 
an Authorization describes a role or permission to perform some business 
function.  Even if we are describing a role that does not strictly represent 
the authority to do something, such as a contact person, we still use
the perMIT system technical term <b>Authorization</b>.
Every Authorization has three parts: a 
person (who), a function (what) and a qualifier (where). A <b>person</b> is a 
Kerberos username.  A <b>function</b> is what the person may do. A 
<b>qualifier</b> defines the area in which a person may perform that function,
for instance, an organizational unit.
<p />
PAYR Authorizations have Qualifiers from several different hierarchies 
in the perMIT system: 
<blockquote>
  <table border>
    <tr><th align=left>Qualifier&nbsp;<br>type</th>
        <th align=left>Type of objects in the hierarchy</th></tr>
    <tr><td>PMIT&nbsp;</td>
        <td>PCMIT-0 hierarchy of Profit Centers</td></tr>
    <tr><td>PCCS&nbsp;</td><td>Cost Object Supervisors and
        Cost Objects within the PCMIT-0 hierarchy of Profit Centers</td></tr>
    <tr><td>COST&nbsp;</td><td>Cost Objects within the Standard
        hierarchy of Profit Centers</td></tr>
    <tr><td>ORG2&nbsp;</td><td>Hierarchy of 8-digit HR Org. Units</td></tr>
    <tr><td>PYTG&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Time Groups within the HR Org Unit hierarchy</td></tr>
    <tr><td>PDED&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Payroll deduction types</td></tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>
Thus, some PAYR Authorizations have Qualifiers that are financial objects,
and others that are HR Org Units.  Still other PAYR Authorizations are 
"all-or-nothing", and apply to all financial or organizational units 
at MIT; these have a NULL Qualifier.  (The authorizations with a qualifier 
type of PDED, Payroll
deduction type, are also authorizations for central 
administrators, and they apply to all organizational units at MIT.) 
<p />
Like any other category of Authorizations in the perMIT system, 
PAYR Authorizations can be granted at various levels in the pertinent 
hierarchies (e.g., the Org Unit hierarchy, the PCMIT-0 Profit Center
hierarchy, etc.).  For example, if the Authorization uses an HR Org Unit 
as its qualifier, it can be granted at the DLC level (e.g., 
10000429 Biology), a school or area level (e.g., 10000030 Science Area), 
or a higher level (e.g., 10000001 Provost Area, or 10000000 MIT-All).
When an Authorization is granted at a higher level than a DLC, the
Authorization applies to all DLCs within that area.  Thus, 
an Authorization whose qualifier is 1000030 Science Area applies to
10000429 Biology, 10000491 Chemistry, 10000533 Mathematics, etc..
<p />
Authorizations defined in the perMIT system are distributed to the
systems that use the Authorizations for controlling access, 
such as SAP and MIT's Data Warehouse.

<h3>III. View PAYR roles on the web</h3>
<p>
<small>Many employees at MIT are already authorized to HR-related
Authorizations via the Roles web interface.  If you think you should be
authorized to view this information but you are not, see the rules for
who is allowed to view Authorizations described in the memo
<a href="/metaauth_help.html">
perMIT system Meta-authorizations</a>.</small>
<p>
Click one of the items below to view Payroll-related roles from the Roles
Database.
<ul>
  <li>View PAYR authorizations for a given DLC 
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/cgi-bin/auth_tree_by_dlc.cgi?action=first_page">View PAYR authorizations within various hierarchies</a> <br>
          <small>You will be taken to a web form where you specify a DLC.  
             Then you will see a series of links to take you to displays 
             of PAYR Authorizations related to that DLC within various 
             hierarchies, e.g., PMIT, PCCS, ORG2, and PYTG.</small>
      <p />
      <li><a href="/dlc_auth_generic.html">View PAYR authorizations grouped by person</a> <br>
          <small>You will be taken to a web form where you specify a category
             (such as PAYR or HR) and a department code (such as D_BIOLOGY).  
             The resulting report will show 
             authorizations grouped by person for the specified category and
             DLC.</small>
