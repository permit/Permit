This web page allows you to view a hierarchy of Fund Centers qualifiers,
color-coded to indicate their Release Strategies.
<P>
If you know the custom or standard Fund Center
for the branch of the tree you want to view, enter it;  
otherwise leave it 
blank and the display will start at the root of the Fund Center hierarchy.
(Qualifier codes must start with the appropriate prefix - 
<a href="qualcode_prefix.html">see explanation</a>.)
Then click the <strong>Submit</strong> button.
