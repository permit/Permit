<p>
In the perMIT system, an <strong>Authorization</strong> is a rule that 
lets you perform a specific business function within a computer-based 
application. Authorizations have three main parts: Person, 
Function, and Qualifier, plus some flags and timestamp fields. (See 
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/rolesdb/www/intro.html#two">
Introduction to the perMIT system application</a>.) A <strong>Person</strong>
can perform a business <strong>Function</strong> limited by a 
<strong>Qualifier</strong>.  
<p>
Qualifiers can be Funds, Fund Centers, Organizational Units, etc..  
(See a list of 
<a href="quallist1.html">qualifier types</a>.)
In each Authorization, the type of Qualifier must fit the Function. 
For example,
an Authorization for CAN SPEND OR COMMIT FUNDS must have a Qualifier of type
"FUND" (Fund or Fund Center), whereas an Authorization for "REPORT BY CO/PC"
must have a Qualifier of type COST (Profit Center or Cost Object).
<p>
Some Functions, such as the various JV
Functions, are either "on or off", and are not restricted by a Qualifier. (Or,
in the case of "REQUISITIONER" or "CREDIT CARD VERIFIER", the Function is
linked to the Qualifier on "CAN SPEND OR COMMIT FUNDS" authorizations.)
All Authorizations for
these Functions have a Qualifier of <strong>NULL</strong>. 
The Person is allowed to perform the Function, and NULL is a 
simply a placeholder for the Qualifier field.
<p>
The "Authorizations for a Person" display contains
a list of Authorizations for a person within a single category
or application (such as SAP) or for all categories.  Your ability to view
Authorizations for other people is controlled by a kind of 
<a href="metaauth_help.html">meta-authorization</a>.
The display includes the following fields:
<p>
<table border>
<tr><th>Function<BR>Category</th><td>
The application or system, such as SAP or the Data Warehouse, to which
the Authorization applies.  (See a 
<A href="/cgi-bin/rolecat.pl">
list of Function Categories</A>.)
</td></tr>
<tr><th>Function<BR>Name</th><td>The short name of the Function component
of the Authorization.  (See a 
<A href="/cgi-bin/rolecat.pl">  
list of Functions within a Function Category</A>.) If the function name
is shown in <font color=gray>gray</font>, then the authorization is not in 
effect due to the do_function flag or expiration/effective dates.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Qualifier<BR>Code</th><td>The Organizational Unit, Fund Center, Cost
Object, or other item that limits the data for which the Person can perform
the Function.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Do<BR>Function</th><td>Y (Person can do the business Function), or
N (cannot).  N is specified for people who
can grant an Authorization but cannot perform the business Function 
themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Grant</th><td>Y (Person can grant the Authorization) or N (cannot).
</td></tr>
<tr><th>Effective<BR>Today</th><td>Y (Authorization is in effect today) or
N (Authorization is expired or does not go into effect until a future date).
</td></tr>
<tr><th>Click for<BR>Details</th><td>
Click on the asterisk (<A href="asterisk.html"> *</A>) for more
details on the Authorization.</td></tr>
