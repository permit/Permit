-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The crontab file in this directory may be edited and then the system
version updated via the crontab command.

	Crontab File:		crontab.cinnamon
	Crontab Command:	crontab crontab.cinnamon

By convention, each crontab entry calls a script in the directory:
	$HOME/permit/feeds/cronjobs

Each cronjob script is responsible for sourcing the shell configuration file
for redirecting the command output to an appropriate log file.
