In the fall of 2006, we will make changes to the schema of the Roles DB 
to accommodate new features:
  -- "sensitive" qualifier types (i.e., those whose qualifier_names can
     only be viewed by specially-authorized users)
  -- external authorizations (i.e., those implied by external sources of
     data)
  -- a status field in the qualifier table, set to 'I' if the qualifier
     is due to be deleted but cannot be deleted because it has 
     child qualifiers or authorizations

To install the changes, do the following:

x 1. Alter the qualifier_type table
   
   alter_qualtype.sql

x 2. Create tables external_auth and external_function;
   also create authorization2 view.  

   new_schema29.sql.

x 3. Create the table suppressed_qualifier

   new_schema30.sql

x 4. Alter the qualifier table

   alter_qualifier.sql

x 5. Add an index to the authorization table(?)
   Not needed on production machine. (add_index5.sql)

x 6. Install new roles_qual.pm

x 7. Install roles_rset.pm

x 8. Install roles_extauth.pm

x 9. Add functions and authorizations related to RSET qualifier type

10. New version of qualauth.pl
