Hi John,

I don't know specifically which, if any, Roles DB functions are used for
the Housing Billing application. The Student Information Systems people 
have usually been self-reliant about setting up their own Functions and
Authorizations in the Roles Database.

I've listed Roles DB functions below that have been created or modified
since the beginning of 2005 in the categories GAID (Graduate Aid), 
GRAD (Graduate Admissions), and XSIS (Student Systems).  I also included 
two functions in the category UADM (Undergrad Admissions) that were created
in 2004.

The functions SFS_HFS_MANAGER (Housing Manager) and 
SFS_VIEW_ONLY (View only for SISTIM users) in the category 
GRAD might apply to the application you are examining.
The functions in category XSIS were set up by Huey Chan of the Warehouse
team, and as far as she knows, they are only being used for the Warehouse.

                                      Jim
