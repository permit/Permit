Fixing one problem that can occur in nightly Roles DB data feeds  
(where we run out of qualifier_id's for a qualifier_type and get a
unique constraint rdb_pk_q_qualifier_id error).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The description below applies to getting an error for a cost object, and 
the fix involved moving qualifier_id numbers for ORG2-type qualifiers.
However, the technique would apply generically to similar errors for
other qualifier types.

In the nightly feed program for Profit Centers and Cost Objects, we got
the following error message:
 insert into qualifier (QUALIFIER_ID, QUALIFIER_CODE, QUALIFIER_NAME, 
 QUALIFIER_TYPE, CUSTOM_HIERARCHY, HAS_CHILD, QUALIFIER_LEVEL) 
 values('520000','I4537317','Please Install A Fire Extinguisher', 'COST',
 'N','N','8')
 ERROR at line 1:
 ORA-00001: unique constraint (ROLESBB.RDB_PK_Q_QUALIFIER_ID) violated

This meant that the feed program was trying to insert a record into the 
RDB_T_QUALIFIER table (synonym QUALIFIER) with qualifier_id = 520000, but
a qualifier already existed in the table with qualifier_id = 520000.

Why would the feed program have this error?  

The answer has to do with the way that the qualifier table is organized.
Each qualifier type has a range of qualifier_id numbers to use.  This 
has usually worked fine, because qualifiers of a given type do not change 
very often, and never need more than 100,000 or so numbers in a range. 
However, qualifiers of type COST and FUND are numerous, and keep growing.
If the next sequential qualifier_id number for a given qualifier_type bumps
up into the lowest qualifier_id number of the next type, then we get this
error message.

You can see the various qualifier types and ranges of numbers in use by
entering the SELECT statement
  select qualifier_type, min(qualifier_id), max(qualifier_id)
  from qualifier
  group by qualifier_type
  order by min(qualifier_id);

From the data above, we see that 
the range of QUALIFIER_IDs available for qualifiers of type COST was limited 
to 400001 - 519999.  It cannot go above 519999 because there is a type-ORG2
qualifier with qualifier_id 520000.  We've run out of numbers for 
the COST qualifiers.  
We need to move the qualifiers of the type getting in the way of 
the COST qualifiers, i.e., qualifiers of type ORG2 (currently 520000, 521000) 
to make more room for COST qualifiers.
We'll move them to the range starting at 870000.

Here is what we will do to fix the problem:
 0. Print a copy of ORG2 authorizations and save for later verification.
    (Get this from Rolesweb.)
 1. Add two temporary qualifier types to the qualifier_type table.
      insert into qualifier_type values ('TST1', 'Temp qualtype 1');
      insert into qualifier_type values ('TST2', 'Temp qualtype 2');
 2. Clone the ORG2 qualifiers.
      insert into qualifier
        (QUALIFIER_ID, qualifier_code, qualifier_name, qualifier_type, 
         HAS_CHILD, QUALIFIER_LEVEL, CUSTOM_HIERARCHY)
        select QUALIFIER_ID+350000, qualifier_code, qualifier_name, 'TST1',
               has_child, qualifier_level, custom_hierarchy
        from qualifier where qualifier_type = 'ORG2';
 3. Clone the ORG2-related records in qualifier_child and qualifier_descendent
      insert into qualifier_child
        (parent_id, child_id)
        select PARENT_ID+350000, CHILD_ID+350000
        from qualifier_child where parent_id between 520000 and 521000;
      insert into qualifier_descendent
        (parent_id, child_id)
        select PARENT_ID+350000, CHILD_ID+350000
        from qualifier_descendent where parent_id between 520000 and 521000;
 4. Clone the ORG2-related records in primary_auth_descendent
      insert into primary_auth_descendent
       (parent_id, child_id, is_dlc)
       select parent_id, child_id+350000, is_dlc
       from primary_auth_descendent
       where child_id between 520000 and 521000;
 5. There is no need to move DEPT links for ORG2-related objects, since 
    they are "cloned" qualifier records anyway.  Nothing to do here.
 6. Move qualifier_id's in AUTHORIZATIONs
      update authorization set qualifier_id = qualifier_id+350000
         where qualifier_id between 520000 and 521000;
 7. Flip qualifier types for old and new ORG2 records
      update qualifier set qualifier_type = 'TST2'
             where qualifier_type = 'ORG2';
      update qualifier set qualifier_type = 'ORG2'
             where qualifier_type = 'TST1';
 8. Check on web and in Roles application to make sure that people still 
    have the same authorizations in ORG2 hierarchy
 9. delete old records from primary_auth_descendent
      delete from primary_auth_descendent
       where child_id between 520000 and 521000;
 10. delete old records from qualifier_child and qualifier_descendent
      delete from qualifier_child
       where child_id between 520000 and 521000;
      delete from qualifier_descendent
       where child_id between 520000 and 521000;
 11. delete old records from qualifier
      delete from qualifier
       where qualifier_id between 520000 and 521000;
 12. delete test qualifier types from qualifier_type
      delete from qualifier_type where qualifier_type in ('TST1', 'TST2');
