I'd like to ask about SAP-upgrade-related testing of EHS-related data in the
Warehouse as part of the overall plan for testing the Roles DB to SAP 
interfaces related to EHS.  There are specific tables from the Warehouse
that are the source of EHS-related data in the Roles DB:
     wareuser.whehsta_pi_work_area
     wareuser.whehsta_reconciler_detail
     wareuser.whehss_work_area
     wareuser.whehss_function_detail
     wareuser.whehss_function
     (wareuser.krb_person - used by this process, but unrelated to EHS on SAP)
Is it the case that there has been a test, or will be a test, to verify
that the Warehouse programs will still be able to extract these tables from
SAP following the upgrade?

Background:

I recently spoke to Rob Damian about doing SAP-upgrade related testing for
the procedures that send EHS-related data from the Roles DB to SAP. The 
Roles DB sends to SAP (a) profiles and authorizations, as part of the
process that also sends HR and Financial profiles and authorizations to
SAP and (b) a special file containing DLC-level EHS relationship data 
derived from category-EHS authorizations in the Roles DB.

To test the processes, Rob and I agreed that
  (i) The profiles and authorizations being sent are a subset of the
      financial/HR/EHS data sent in a single process each morning.  This
      process is being tested by George Petrowsky and others 
      as part of HR/financial authorizations testing, and does not need 
      to be tested separately for EHS.
  (ii) The special file of DLC-level relationships invokes an EHS-specific 
       program on SAP and this must be tested separately.  I will work with 
       Rob to produce appropriate data for testing the program on SAP.
  (iii) The Roles DB -> EHS processes depend on getting data about 
        PIs, work areas, relationships, etc. from Warehouse tables 
        that contain the data.  If there has been a test to confirm that
        the Warehouse programs that load the applicable tables in the 
        Warehouse will continue to work after the upgrade, then that 
        testing should be sufficient to ascertain that the Roles DB 
        tables of EHS-related data will continue to function after the
        SAP upgrade.
        
More details about the Roles DB -> EHS (SAP) processes:

There are three programs within the Roles DB that are involved in reading
or sending out EHS-related data from/to SAP.

1. Roles DB perl module name: roles_rset.pm

   Purpose: Update Roles DB "qualifier" hierarchy of DLCs, PIs, Room Sets and
            Rooms.

   Tables from the Warehouse:
     wareuser.whehsta_pi_work_area wa
     wareuser.whehss_work_area
     (wareuser.krb_person - used by this process, but unrelated to EHS on SAP)


2. Roles DB perl module name: roles_extauth.pm

   Purpose: Update "external" authorizations derived from SAP-defined EHS
            relationships.  Authorizations are implied for PIs, and people
            with relationships to Room Sets and Rooms.

   Tables from the Warehouse:
     wareuser.whehss_work_area
     wareuser.whehss_function_detail
     wareuser.whehss_function
     wareuser.whehsta_pi_work_area
     wareuser.whehsta_reconciler_detail
     (wareuser.krb_person - used by this process, but unrelated to EHS on SAP)


3. Roles DB perl module name: proc_ehs_role2.pl

   Purpose: Part of a set of perl scripts to compare DLC-level relationship
            data with Roles DB EHS authorizations (at DLC-level) and send 
            a file of differences to the SAP dropbox, where an SAP program
            applies the differences in SAP.

   Tables from the Warehouse:
     wareuser.whehss_work_area
     wareuser.whehss_function_detail
     wareuser.whehss_function
